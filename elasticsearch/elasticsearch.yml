# ======================== Elasticsearch Configuration =========================
#
# NOTE: Elasticsearch comes with reasonable defaults for most settings.
#       Before you set out to tweak and tune the configuration, make sure you
#       understand what are you trying to accomplish and the consequences.
#
# The primary way of configuring a node is via this file. This template lists
# the most important settings you may want to configure for a production cluster.
#
# Please consult the documentation for further information on configuration options:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/index.html
#
# ---------------------------------- Cluster -----------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for your cluster:
#
cluster.name: futureprogram-log-cluster

#give your nodes a name (change node number from node to node).
node.name: "elastic-master-node-XX"

#define master & data nodes:
node.master: true
node.data: true
node.ingest: true
cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["your-ip-vm-1:9300", "your-ip-vm-1:9300"]

#directory config
path.data: /data/elasticsearch
path.logs: /var/log/elasticsearch

#enter the private IP and port of your node:
network.host: your-ip-vm
http.port: 9200
transport.tcp.port: 9300

#detail the private IPs of your nodes:
discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: ["your-ip-vm-1", "your-ip-vm-2"]
